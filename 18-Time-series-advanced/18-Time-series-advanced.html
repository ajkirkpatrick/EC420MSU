Stationary Time Series

---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### A stationary time series `\(\{x_t: t=1,2,\cdots\}\)` is one where the *joint* distribution of `\((x_t, x_{t+h})\)` is the same as the joint distribution of `\((x_{t+k}, x_{t+h+k}) \forall k,h \geq 1\)`

Remember the idea of a time series being a realization of a sequence? "Pulling a chain" out of a bag of all possible chains?

### Joint Distribution includes
- The mean of `\(x_t\)`
- The mean of `\(x_{t+h}\)`
- The variance of `\(x_t\)`
- The variance of `\(x_{t+h}\)`
- The covariance of `\((x_{t},x_{t+h})\)`

**Stationary** implies *identically distributed*. Imagine `\(h=1\)`. Then `\(x_t\)` and `\(x_{t+1}\)` have the same mean and variance when stationary.
---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### But **stationary** means even more.

### **Stationarity** says that the relationship over time is stable. 
That whatever process drives the relationship between `\(x_t\)` and `\(x_{t+h}\)` also applies, in a random sense, to `\(x_{t+k}\)` and `\(x_{t+h+k}\)`.

class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### Non-stationarity
- Non-stationarity is not uncommon. Think about our time trend regression:
`$$\color{green}{y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,t} + \beta_2 t + u_t}$$`
Ignore the `\(x_{1,t}\)` for a moment. 

Because of the `\(\beta_2 t\)` term, it is clear that the joint distribution of `\((y_t, y_{t+1})\)` is not the same as `\((y_{t+h}, y_{t+1+h})\)`
- For starters, the mean of `\(y_{t+1}\)` is `\(\beta_2\)` higher that `\(y_t\)`, so the joint distribution of `\((y_t,y_{t+h})\)` is different from the joint distribution of `\((y_{t+1},y_{t+1+h})\)`. 
  - But we *can* control for that. 
  - When we can't, though, it becomes a problem

---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### Why is non-stationarity a problem?
&gt; (I)f we want to understand the relationship between tow or more variables using regression analysis, we need to asssume some sort of stability over time. If we allow the relationship between two variables to change arbitrarily in each time period, then we cannot hope to learn much about how a change in one affects the other(...)

&lt;br&gt;

### Much of time series econometrics is about being very specific as to how big of a problem this may be, and when it stops being a problem
- If we assume that everything past one lag is uncorrelated, time series is very easy!
- We already saw that assuming `\(y_t\)` has no effect on `\(x_{t+1}\)` made things very easy!


---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### A weaker form of stationarity is **covariance stationarity**
This holds when:
1. `\(E[x_t]\)` is constant
2. `\(Var(x_t)\)` is constant
3. For any `\(t,h\)`, `\(Cov(x_t, x_{t+h})\)` depends only on `\(h\)`, not on `\(t\)`.

The first two are straightforward. The third simply means that the correlation structure is the same.
- `\(x_1\)` and `\(x_3\)` may be correlated...
- ...but `\(x_2\)` and `\(x_4\)` have the same correlation
- Correlation is a *population* concept.

### This is sometimes called *weak stationarity*

### TS5, "no correlation in `\(u_t, u_{t+h}\)`", meets this

---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### Let's pause for a moment

These conditions are all ways of saying that 

&gt; "regardless of *where* in the chain our sample is drawn, we can learn about *how* the chain behaves from our observation".

--

## Any questions?

---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### Stationarity is about how stable the relationship is between `\((x_{t},x_{t+h})\)`
For a variety of `\(t\)` and `\(h\)`

### We need a concept that tells us how large `\(h\)` has to be to say that `\(x_t\)` and `\(x_{t+h}\)` are essentially unrelated

--

### Weak dependence
A **weakly dependent** time series `\(\{x_t:1,2,\cdots\}\)` is one where, as `\(h\)` gets larger, `\(x_t\)` and `\(x_{t+h}\)` become "almost independent".
- If it is *covariance stationary* and
- `\(Cov(x_t, x_{t+h}) \rightarrow 0\)` as `\(h\rightarrow \infty\)`
- "Asymptotically uncorrelated"


---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### If a time series is weakly dependent, then we have a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and Law of Large Numbers (LLN) that can apply
The CLT is what let us say that we could ignore non-normal errors
The LLN is what let us say that averages, with large enough `\(N\)`, are unbiased estimates of the population average.
- This let us say that `\(E[\hat{\beta}]=\beta\)`
---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### One useful weakly dependent model: **Moving Average**
`$$\color{darkorange}{x_t = e_t + \alpha_1 e_{t-1}}$$`
- `\(e_t\)` is a random i.i.d. sequence with zero mean and constant variance
- The  process `\(\{x_t\}\)` is a **Moving Average of order one (MA(1))**

---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

`$$\color{darkorange}{x_t = e_t + \alpha_1 e_{t-1}}$$`

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:center;"&gt; t &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:center;"&gt; e &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:center;"&gt; x &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 1 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; -0.4 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; NA &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 2 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; -0.8 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; -1.00 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 3 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; -0.9 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; -1.30 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 4 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 0.1 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; -0.35 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 5 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 1.7 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 1.75 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
### `\(x\)` has constant mean, constant variance

### `\(x_t\)` and `\(x_{t+h}\)` have the same covariance `\(\forall\)` `\(h\)`

### `\(Cov(x_t, x_{t+h})=0 \quad \forall h\geq 2\)`

---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### We can go beyond the first lag of `\(e\)` and have a MA(2) or more...
`$$x_t = e_t + \alpha_1 e_{t-1} + \alpha_2 e_{t-2}$$`

- This is still stationary
- This is still weakly dependent

---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### Another useful model: **Autoregressive**
`$$\color{red}{y_t = \rho_1 y_{t-1} + e_t}$$`
- `\(\{e_t:t=1, 2, \cdots\}\)` is i.i.d. with zero mean and constant variance `\(\sigma^2_e\)`
- So `\(e_t\)` is independent of `\(y\)`
- Each `\(y_t\)` is equal to some fraction of the previous `\(y_t\)` **and** that new error term, `\(e_t\)`.
  - Sometimes called an "innovation"
- There is some `\(y_0\)` that started it all


### Imagine for a moment that `\(\rho_1&gt;&gt;1\)`
- How does `\(y_t\)` behave over time?


---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### The **AR(1)** process:
`$$\Large \color{red}{y_t = \rho_1 y_{t-1} + e_t}$$`
### We can show that, if `\(\rho_1&lt;1\)`, then `\(y_t\)`, our **AR(1)** process, is weakly dependent.
- `\(\rho_1 &lt; 1\)` is called a "stable AR(1)"
--

This is largely because `\(e_t \perp y_{t-1}\)` (independent)

`\(Var(y_t) = Var(\rho_1 y_{t-1}) + Var(e_t) = \rho_1^2 Var(y_{t-1}) + Var(e_{t})\)`


`\(\Rightarrow \sigma^2_y = \rho^2 \sigma^2_y + \sigma^2_e\)`
  
As long as `\(\rho&lt;1 \rightarrow \rho^2&lt;1\)`, then we can get:
`$$\sigma^2_y = \frac{\sigma^2_e}{1-\rho_1^2}$$`

---
class: MSU
# Stationary TS

### Wooldridge 11-1 shows that `\(Corr(y_t, y_{t+10})&gt;Corr(y_t, y_{t+20})\)` when `\(\rho&lt;1\)`
Thus, AR(1) is weakly dependent.

--

### But how does weakly dependent help?

Asymptotic Properties of TS OLS

---
class: MSU
# New Assumptions

### TS.1' - Linearity and Weak Dependence
`$$\{(\mathbf{x}_t, y_t):t = 1, 2, \cdots\}\text{ is stationary and weakly dependent}$$`

in a model such as:

`$$y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,t} + \beta_2 x_{1,t-1} + \cdots + \beta_j y_{t-1} + u_{t}$$`
Note that
- `\(\mathbf{x}\)` has `\(x\)` and lags of `\(x\)`
- `\(\mathbf{x}\)` also has lags of `\(y\)`

### Really, we just need weak dependence, but Wooldridge includes stationarity

--

### TS.2' - No Perfect Multicolinearity (same as before)

---
class: MSU
# New Assumptions

### TS.3' - `\(\mathbf{x}_t\)` is contemporaneously exogenous
`$$E[u_t | \mathbf{x}_t] = 0$$`

We've relaxed that pernicious **strict exogeneity** assumption from before by adding TS.1'

- Remember, **strict exogeneity** was `\(E[u_t | \mathbf{X}]=0\)`, all future values of `\(\mathbf{x}_t\)`.

- So as long as TS.1' and TS.3' hold, we don't have to worry about correlation between `\(u_{t-1}\)` and `\(x_t\)`, even when it's because `\(x_t\)` is related to past `\(y_{t-1}\)`!



---
class: MSU
# New Assumptions

### With TS.1', TS.2', TS.3', `\(\hat{\beta}\)` is consistent
Not necessarily unbiased, but with larger and larger `\(N\)`, the estimate gets better!

So our **AR(q)** model estimators, if it meets TS.1'-TS.3', are consistent.
- To meet TS.1', it has to be stable

So are our **MA(q)** model estimators.

So are our FDL estimators, even when future values of `\(x_t\)` are affected by `\(y_{t-1}\)`

---
class: MSU
# New Assumptions

### TS.4' - Contemporaneous homoskedasticity
`$$Var(u_t|\mathbf{x}_t) = \sigma^2$$`

As opposed to TS.4 - `\(Var(u_t | \mathbf{X}) = \sigma^2\)`
&lt;br&gt;
### TS.5' - No Serial Correlation
`$$Corr(u_t, u_s | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{x}_s) = 0 \quad \forall t,s$$`
As Wooldridge says, ignore the conditioning and just think of whether or not `\(u_t\)` and `\(u_s\)` are correlated.

--

Note that specifying an **AR(1)** when the real process is **AR(2)** results in serial correlation (because `\(y_{t-2}\)` is in the error and `\(y_t\)` is serially correlated)

---
class: MSU
# New Assumptions

### Under TS.1'-TS.5', the errors are asymptotically normally distributed
Which lets us use `\(t\)`-statistics, `\(F\)`-tests, confidence intervals, p-value, etc.

We've skipped assuming normal errors and gone straight to using the **asymptotic properties**.

So we need to be able to say we have a large `\(N\)`
- Which means a large `\(T\)`

---
class: MSU
# New Assumptions

Serial correlation in `\(u\)` is not the end of the world. We won't get to the solution, but briefly, here's how it works:

### Heteroskedasticity and Autorcorrelation-Consistent Errors
or **HAC**, are calculated for each `\(\beta_j\)` by multiplying each "naive" OLS std. error by a correction factor, `\(\hat{v}_j\)`
- `\(\hat{v}_j\)` is a function of two things:
  - `\(u_t\)`, as one would expect
  - `\(r_t\)`, where `\(r_t\)` is the error in `\(x_{jt} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 x_{kt} + \cdots + r_t\)`
  - When `\(\hat{u}_t\)` covaries with `\(\hat{r}_t\)` (the part of `\(x_{jt}\)` not explained by `\(\mathbf{x}_t\)`), the correction factor `\(\hat{v}_j\)` gets bigger.
  - When lags of `\(\hat{u}_t \times \hat{r}_t\)` covary, `\(\hat{v}_j\)` gets bigger.
  - How many lags to include is a question for another day (1? 2? 10?)

Random Walk

---
class: MSU
# Random Walk

### A **random walk** is a highly persistent time series
It is not *weakly dependent*, so it poses a problem to TS.1'-TS.5'

### A random walk is a process that follows:
`$$y_t = \rho y_{t-1} + e_t \text{ where } \rho=1$$`
and `\(e\)` is iid, `\(E[e] = 0\)` (mean zero errors) and `\(Var(e) = \sigma^2_e\)`
&lt;img src="18-Time-series-advanced_files/figure-html/RW1-1.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
class: MSU
# Random Walk

### We can write
`$$y_t = \color{purple}{y_{t-1}} + e_t$$`
which is the same as 
`$$y_t = \color{purple}{y_{t-2} + e_{t-1}} + e_{t}$$`
which generalizes to:
`$$y_t = y_0 + e_{1} + e_{2} + \cdots + e_{t}$$`

---
class: MSU
# Random Walk

### A Random Walk has a constant `\(E[y_t]\)`
`$$y_t = y_0 + e_{1} + e_{2} + \cdots + e_{t}$$`
means
`$$E[y_t] = E[y_0] + 0 + 0 + \cdots + 0$$`

### But a Random Walk does not have constant variance:
`$$Var(y_t) = Var(y_0) + Var(e_1) + Var(e_2) + \cdots + Var(e_t)$$`
Which is `\(t\sigma^2_e\)`, so it changes over time!

--

### A Random Walk is not stationary and TSR.1'-TSR.5' do not hold!

### Nor is a Random Walk covariance-stationary (depends on `\(t\)`), and is not weakly dependent.
