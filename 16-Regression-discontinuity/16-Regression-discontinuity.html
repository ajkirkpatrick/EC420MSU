- Diff-in-diff

  - Made an assumption (parallel trends)
  
  - That let us say we know `\(E[Y_0|D=1]\)`

  - Had to use the Parallel Trends assumption
  
  - Could estimate as a regression (simple!)
  
- Synthetic

  - Concept: pre-treatment match gives us post-treatment counterfactual

# Regression Discontinuity

### Let's return to the endogeneity issue:
`$$\color{blue}{y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 x_{i} + u_{i}}$$`

And we have the usual endogeneity problem that: `\(D_i\)` may be correlated with `\(u_i\)`, even once we condition on exogenous `\(x_i\)`.

--

### Let's set up an example
.pull-left[
- `\(y_i\)` is semesters of college attended
- `\(D_i\)` is "getting a scholarship"
]

.pull-right[

- `\(x_i\)` is parental income
- `\(u_i\)` is potentially endogenous error
]

We might think that *ability*
  1. Affects semesters of college attended
  2. Unobserved (and thus in `\(u_i\)`)
  3. Correlated with getting a scholarship

--

`$$\Rightarrow (Y_{i0},Y_{i1}) \not\perp D_i | x_i$$`

# Regression Discontinuity

### Let's return to the endogeneity issue:
`$$\color{blue}{y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 x_{i} + u_{i}}$$`

### What if we had a scholarship that was awarded to all students with a 1200 SAT score or above?
- `\(D_i = 1(SAT_i &gt; 1200)\)`

### Does this solve our endogeneity problem?
- Is `\(SAT_i\)`, the student's SAT score, exogenous?
--

- What do we learn about scholarships in general from understanding the effect of *this* particular scholarship? We'll return to this in a little bit.

# Regression Discontinuity

### Does this solve our endogeneity problem?
- Is `\(SAT_i\)`, the student's SAT score, exogenous?

### What if I compared a student with an 800 to a student with a 1600 (and with the exact same `\(x_i\)`)

- Would you be concerned about that unobserved *ability* in `\(u_i\)`?

--

### What about comparing a 900 student to a 1500 student?

--

### What about comparing a 1000 student to a 1400 student?

--

### What about comparing a 1100 student to a 1300 student?

# Regression Discontinuity

### What about comparing a 1190 student to a 1210 student?

### What about comparing a 1199 student to a 1201 student?

# Regression Discontinuity

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The intuition behind RD is as follows:
### If we compare students within a *small enough window* around a threshold, then treatment `\(D_i\)` is **as good as randomly assigned**

--

And *as good as randomly assigned* lets us treat the treatment as **exogenous**

The *unobserved* endogenous problem in `\(u_i\)` is no longer a problem.


---
class: MSU
# Regression Discontinuity

### What do we need for an RD?
I. A **threshold**
  - And it has to be exogenous
  - Usually from a policy
  - Arbitrary policies are...great!

# Regression Discontinuity

### What do we need for an RD?
II. A **running variable**
  - We need some variable that crosses the threshold
    - It cannot be binary
  - It has to be *observed*
  - It has to determine the treatment of interest `\(^\dagger\)`
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&gt; "Although treatment isn't randomly assigned, we know where it comes from"

`\(^\dagger\)` A *fuzzy* RD relaxes this assumption]

class: MSU
# Regression Discontinuity

### The **running variable** in our example is SAT score
- Crosses the threshold
- Non-binary
- Observed
- Determines scholarship (treatment) discontinuously
  - A "jump"

---
class: MSU
# Regression Discontinuity

### What do we need for an RD?
III. A **window**
  - We need somewhere to "draw the line"
  - In our SAT example, some of us would have been OK with 1150 and 1250. 
    - Some would want 1190 to 1210
    - Some would say 1195 to 1205



---
class: MSU
# Regression Discontinuity

### A **threshold**
- Set exogenously

### A **running variable**
- Determines treatment
- Continuous
- Observable

### A **window**
- How close is close enough

### The identifying assumption:
.large[Within a small enough **window**, the treatment (as determined by the **running variable** and the **threshold**) is as good as randomly assigned]

---
class: MSU
# Regression Discontinuity

### Specification of an RD
- Let's call the running variable `\(x_r\)`
- Let's call the threshold `\(\tau\)`
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
--

### Our RD equation would be:
`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 x_{i,r} + \beta_3 x_{exogenous} + u_i$$`

.pull-left[
- `\(y_i\)` is outcome
- `\(D_i=1(x_{i,r} &gt; \tau)\)`
- `\(\tau\)` is the threshold
]

.pull-right[
- `\(x_{i,r}\)` is the *running variable*
- `\(x_{i, exogenous}\)` is an exogenous covariate (a control)
- `\(u_i\)` is the error
]


---
class: MSU
# Regression Discontinuity

### Our RD equation would be:
`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 x_{i,r} + \beta_3 x_{exogenous} + u_i$$`

and

`$$D_i = 1(x_{i,r} &gt; \tau)$$`

&lt;br&gt;
#### Note that we have a continuous running variable `\(x_{i,r}\)` with a linear coefficient
- We can still control for the effect of the running variable
- That's why we need the `\(\tau\)` threshold where treatment "jumps"

#### And we can still control for other things
- `\(x_{exogenous}\)`

---
class: MSU
# Regression Discontinuity

### Our RD equation would be:
`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 x_{i,r} + \beta_3 x_{exogenous} + u_i$$`

#### But where is the window?
- We *could* just use a sample within the window
- Define the window as being (a,b)
  - R: `myData[myData$xir &gt;=a &amp; myData$xir &lt;=b,]`
--

- Another option is to use *local linear regresion*, which can be implemented as a *weighted regression*

---
class: MSU
# Weighted Regression

### A quick aside to establish weighted regression:
We know that OLS minimizes the sum of the squared error term `\(u_i\)`
`$$\sum (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_1)^2 = \sum (u_i)^2$$`

### Weighted regression just puts weights on that sum:
`$$\sum w_i(u_i)^2$$`
and 

`$$\sum w_i = 1$$`

---
class: MSU
# Weighted Regression

### Weights can set the estimation sample
If we said that `\(w_i=0\)` if `\(i\)` is not "in the window", and constant otherwise, we would just be setting the estimating sample.

### Weights can be continuous
What if we set `\(w_i\)` to be some function of *how far away from the threshold* an observation `\(x_{i,r}\)` is?
- If `\(x_{i,r}\)` is far away from `\(\tau\)`, then it gets a low weight
- If `\(x_{i,r}\)` is practically equal to `\(\tau\)`, then it gets a high weight

`$$\tilde{w_i} = \frac{1}{|x_{i,r}-\tau|}$$`

Of course, we might have to re-scale all the `\(w_i\)`'s to make sure they add to 1:

`$$w_i = \frac{\tilde{w}_i}{\sum_{j=1}^N \tilde{w}_j}$$`


---
class: MSU
# Weighted Regression

### This "local linear regression" because it puts more weight on those observations where `\(x_{i,r}\)` is very close to `\(\tau\)`
- You still have to determine the form of the weights
- We call the function that generates weights the *kernel*
- Since we are not making an assumption about how the distance away from `\(\tau\)` enters the main regression, this is **non-parametric**.


---
class: MSU
# Weighted Regression

### Other kernels include:
.pull-left[
- Rectangular Kernel
  - Puts equal weight on all observations between `\(a\)` and `\(b\)`]
  
.pull-right[
- Triangle Kernel
  - Puts weight on those closer to the center
]

# Regression Discontinuity

Applying weights to OLS is easy:

`myOLS = lm(Y ~ X1 + D + X2, data=myData, weights = 1/abs(myData$X1 - tau))`

### Example 1
Maimonides Rule
- 12th century rabbinic scholar who determined that 40 students was the max. class size.
- Anything larger had to be cut into two 20/21-person classes
- Angrist and Lavy (1999) used threshold to look at effect of class size on student outcomes
--

  - What is the endogeneity problem between student outcomes and *assignment* of class sizes?
  - What is the threshold and is it exogenously set?
  - What is running variable?
  - Evaluate whether or not we have an as-good-as-random treatment assignment

### Example 2
Superfund cleanup
- All superfund sites have a risk score
- Congress determines how far down the 
- Greenstone and Gallagher (2008) and Gamper-Rabindran and Timmins (2011) used threshold to look at effect of cleanup on housing prices
--

  - What is the endogeneity problem between home values and *assignment* of superfund cleanup?
  - What is the threshold and is it exogenously set?
  - What is the running variable?
  - Evaluate whether or not we have an as-good-as-random treatment assignment

# Running Variables

`$$\color{blue}{y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 x_{i,r} + u_{i}}$$`

&lt;img src="MMfig43a.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
class: MSU
# Running Variables

`$$\color{green}{y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 x_{i,r} + \beta_3 x_{i,r}^2 + \beta_4 x_{i,r}^3 + u_{i}}$$`

&lt;img src="MMfig43b.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
class: MSU
# Running Variables

`$$\color{brown}{y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 (x_{i,r}-\tau) + \beta_3 (x_{i,r}-\tau) * D_i + u_{i}}$$`
Here, we let the *slope* of the coefficient on the running variable change when it crosses the threshold. To the left of the threshold, `\(\frac{dy}{dx_{i,r}}=\beta_2\)`, and to the right, it is `\(\beta_2 + \beta_3\)` (dashed line).

class: MSU
# Running Variables

&lt;img src="MMfig43c.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

This one is not so good - the dashed line fits a possible non-linear trend.
- Note that there is an upward trend just before the threshold
- That trend is more consistent with a polynomial trend, and the linear trend + threshold gives a false effect.

---
class: MSU
# RD Diagnostics

### The implicit assumption in our RD "window"
is that everything else *around* the threshold `\(\tau\)` varies *smoothly*
- Then, we can control for it parametrically.

### Which means that *other variables* not affected by the treatment should vary smoothly over the threshold
- After all, if some unrelated variable is "jumping" at the threshold, then we shouldn't have much confidence in that threshold being exogenous
  - And this would ruin our assumption.
  
  
&gt; (Z)ero effects on outcomes that should be unchanged by treatment raise our confidence in the causal effects we are after

# Fuzzy RD

### What if the threshold doesn't perfectly determine treatment, but the other assumptions hold?
In this case, we would have:
- Something exogenous
- That has an affect on treatment
- But doesn't affect outcome except through treatment

--

### It's an instrument!

---
class: MSU
# Fuzzy RD

Back to our original example, except maybe we don't have perfect awarding of scholarships to SAT&gt;1200

### First Stage:
`$$\color{red}{SCHOLARSHIP_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 SAT_i + \alpha_2 1(SAT_i&gt;1200) + \alpha_3 x_i + v_i}$$`
This is just like our .blue[original] equation, but with `\(SCHOLARSHIP_i\)` on the LHS.

---
class: MSU
# Fuzzy RD


### Second Stage:
`$$\color{red}{y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \widehat{SCHOLARSHIP}_i + \beta_2 SAT_i + \beta_3 x_i + u_i}$$`

`\(\beta_1\)` is our treatment of interest.

Note that `\(SAT_i\)` is still in the second stage **but** the threshold dummy `\(1(SAT_i&gt;1200)\)` is *not*.

This just follows the IV method, but gets the first-stage exogeneity from the RD specification! The *crossing of the threshold* is the exogenous event.

---
class: MSU
# Fuzzy RD

### In practice...
We rarely get a threshold that is perfectly "sharp".
- Age of drinking is pretty sharp
- But many other things don't have a perfect relationship

### So fuzzy is more common in the literature
- And remember: when you have an instrument that is almost perfectly correlated with the endogenous variable, IV turns into OLS.
  - If the first stage `\(Z\)` has a perfect prediction of `\(D\)`, then `\(\hat{D}=D=Z\)`
