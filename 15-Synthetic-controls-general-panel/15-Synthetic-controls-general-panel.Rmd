- Synthetic Counterfactual Method (SCM)

class: MSU
# Parallel Trends

### Recall that DiD's *identifying assumption* is that:
> In the absence of treatment, the trends in both groups would have been the same.

### And recall that we can't directly test this
- We can look at pre-treatment trends
- But we would need to see the actual $E[Y_0|D=1]$ in order to ensure that it follows the same trend as $E[Y_0|D=0]$, the untreated group.

---
class: MSU
# Parallel Trends

### We saw examples where that seemed like a pretty safe assumption:
```{r echo=F, include=T, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('MMfig54.png')
```


---
class: MSU
# Parallel Trends

### And some where it didn't necessarily hold
```{r echo=F, include=T, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('MMfig55.png')
```

# Synthetic Counterfactual

### What are we really after?
- We want a good $E[Y_0|D=1]$, the counterfactual for the treated group.
<br><br>
### DiD gets us this by making that link between $E[Y_0|D=0]$ and $E[Y_0|D=1]$
--
<br><br>
So what if we are a little more flexible on how that link is made...?

---
class: MSU
# Synthetic Counterfactual

### Let's start with a DiD specification, but with $i$ individual fixed effects:
$$y_{it} = \beta_0 + \phi_i + \beta_2 POST_t + \beta_3 TREAT_i * POST_t + u_{it}$$
Our assumption here is that, once we condition on the $\phi_i$ - that is, once we let each $i$ have its own intercept, the *trends* are going to be the same.

But what drives those trends...? What moves all $i$ together? And what if there were things that moved, say, 1/2 of the $i$'s?

---
class: MSU
# Synthetic Counterfactual

### Let's say we're looking at city-level unemployment rates over different cities across the US
We want to know the effect of worker safety regulations on unemployment.

### Let's pretend there is one observed thing and *one unobserved thing* that drives the trends:
- **Observed**: national unemployment rate.
- **Unobserved**: Price of canned tomatos.

--

### Why *price of canned tomatoes*?
- Some $i$ have tomato processing facilities in them, and some don't!
- We don't observe this. 
- Treatment may be correlated (tomato processing is particularly dangerous for workers?)


---
class: MSU
# Synthetic Counterfactual

### Would you agree that:
- If the price of tomatoes is very high, there will likely be more employment in tomato-processing facilities?
- And thus, unemployment would be lower (better) in those cities with tomato-processing facilities?

--

### And would you agree that:
- If our treatment is somehow correlated with the presence of tomato-processing facilities, we could be in trouble with our "parallel trends" assumption?
- Treatment may be endogenous (more worker safety rules when more dangerous employment)
- The effect may just be confounded by changes in tomato prices

---
class: MSU
# Synthetic Counterfactual

### What would "tomato prices" do as a confounder?
- If tomato prices go up, **some** $i$'s (the ones with unobserved tomato processing facilities) will have lower unemployment
- So the *parallel trends* assumption is broken:
  - In the absence of treatment, a tomato-processing city would **not** follow the same trend as an untreated non-tomato-processing city.
  
---
class: MSU
# Synthetic Counterfactual

### A "factor loading" model:
- Let $\lambda^{tomato}_{i} = 1(\text{has tomato facility})$
- Let $p^{tomato}_t$ be the national price of tomatos. 

$$y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\lambda^{tomato}_i * p^{tomato}_t) + \beta_2 D_{it} + \phi_i + \delta_t + u_{it}$$

This is just a model of unemployment $y$ as a function of $i$ specific traits, $t$ specific trends in national unemployment rates, and *the effect of tomato prices on unemployment in tomato-processing cities*. 

If $\lambda^{tomato}_i=0$, then price of tomatos has no effect. If $\lambda^{tomato}_i=1$, then the price of tomatos does have an effect $(\beta_1)$.

---
class: MSU
# Synthetic Counterfactual

### A "factor loading" model:
$$y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\lambda^{tomato}_i * p^{tomato}_t) + \beta_2 D_{it} + \phi_i + \delta_t + u_{it}$$

Parallel trends will not hold between a $\lambda^{tomato}_i = 1$ city and a $\lambda^{tomato}_i=0$ city.

### If we observed $\lambda^{tomato}_i$, we'd be fine
We would just control for it (include it in our $X$'s)

But...we don't.

---
class: MSU
# Synthetic Counterfactual

### The Synthetic Counterfactual does its best to account for these unobserved factors
- Even without observing tomato processing facilities or the price of tomatos, we **would** expect that pre-treatment unemployment in tomato processing cities **would look like other tomato processing cities**.

- That is, since the tomato processing cities are subject to the same price of tomatos, then all of them will be a little higher on unemployment when tomato prices are low.

- The Synthetic Counterfactual Method looks for similarity in the pre-treatment trend and develops the counterfactual for $i$ using all $j$'s that have similar pre-treatment "paths".

# Synthetic Counterfactual

### The intuition is that parallel trends assumption is best met by choosing a control pool that...follows parallel trends!

--

All the SCM does is find the controls that
- Are not treated
- But have similar pre-treatment trends

Since it's  straightforward to have parallel trends for **one** treatment unit and some selection of potential controls, the SCM only handles one single treatment unit
- Great for comparative policy analysis
- Some methods for combining results from many SCM's

---
class: MSU
# Synthetic Control

### Implementation
- Usually with a pre-packaged routine in R - `Synth`
- Requires panel data 

User specifies:
- **One** treatment unit
- **Many** potential control units (untreated)
- A treatment start time

---
class: MSU
# Synthetic Control

The Synthetic is estimated by finding weights $w$ that are used to combine all of the un-treated units in the control group.

### Implementation
- R  makes a guess at $w$, weights on each of the control units
  - Let's say the guess is that the weights are $(.5, .5, 0, \cdots, 0)$
  - That is, the first two untreated $i$'s are weighted at .5 and .5, the rest are 0.
  
- The pre-treatment "synthetic" outcome at any pre-treatment time $t$ is:
  - $y^{synth}_{t} = .5 \times y_{1,t} + .5 \times y_{2,t} + 0 \times y_{3,t} + \cdots$
  
---
class: MSU
# Synthetic Control

### Implementation con't.
- The distance between $y^{synth}_t$ and $y^{actual}_t$ is checked. Much like OLS, synth sums the squared difference:
  - $(y^{synth}_t - y^{actual}_t)^2 + (y^{synth}_{t-1} - y^{actual}_{t-1})^2 + \cdots)$ over the pre-treatment period
  - Obviously, post-treatment, we think there will be a difference. Comparing pre-treatment lets us match up tomato-processing cities!
  
- R *guesses* at the weights over and over again until the smalled squared sum of errors is found. Observed covariates can be included as well.

- Those weights define the Synthetic Counterfactual in both the pre-treatment period *and* in the post-treatment.



---
class: MSU
# Synthetic Control

If we get a very good match between $y^{synth}_t$ and $y^{actual}_t$ for all $t$ in the pre-treatment, we would naturally think we have controlled for the unobserved factors (the tomato plants, etc.). 

- If we have controlled for these confounders, *even the unobserved ones*, then we can claim that treatment is "as good as exogenous".
  - $(Y_{0it}, Y_{1it}) \perp D$
  
- Thus, the difference between $Y^{synth}_t$ and $Y^{actual}_t$ **in the post-treatment periods** is the $ATE$
  - $E[Y_0 | D = 1] = E[Y_0^{synth}]$, and the latter is observed.

Let's pull up the Kirkpatrick and Bennear paper and look at the synth implementation there. 

We'll focus on the intuition of the method - how do we claim that we are identifying a *causal* effect of PACE?
